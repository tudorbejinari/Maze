### Tools I used:
* JavaScript 
* Matter Js - to draw the maze on a canvas element.
    * Matter JS has the ability to map key presses to movements of shapes
     * Matter JS has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report them to us as events

### What I learn :  
* a bit about a tree data structure + recursion to implement the simplest algorithm
